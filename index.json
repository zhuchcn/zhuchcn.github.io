Regulatory activities at each step of this transformation multiply a single gene into a myriad of proteoforms. Proteogenomics is the study of how genomic and transcriptomic variation creates this proteoform diversity, and is limited by the challenges of modeling the complexities of gene-expression. We therefore created moPepGen, a graph-based algorithm that comprehensively enumerates proteoforms in linear time. moPepGen works with multiple technologies, in multiple species and on all types of genetic and transcriptomic data. In human cancer proteomes, it detects and quantifies previously unobserved noncanonical peptides arising from germline and somatic genomic variants, noncoding open reading frames, RNA fusions and RNA circularization. By enabling efficient identification and quantitation of previously hidden proteins in both existing and new proteomic data, moPepGen facilitates all proteogenomics applications.

In this study we hypothesized that diets with very different nutrient composition are able to change gut microbiome composition and metabolites in a very short period. We compared a fast food (FF) diet (i.e. burgers and fries) with a Mediterranean (Med) diet, which is rich in vegetables, whole grains, olive oil, nuts, and fish. Ten healthy subjects participated in a controlled cross-over study in which they consumed a Med diet and FF diet in randomized order for 4 days each, with a 4-day washout between treatments. Fecal DNA was extracted and the 16S V4 region amplified using PCR, followed by sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq. Plasma metabolites and bile acids were analyzed using LCMS. Certain bile-tolerant microbial genera and species including Collinsella, Parabacteroides, and Bilophila wadsworthia, were significantly increased after the FF diet. Some fiber-fermenting bacteria, including Lachnospiraceae and Butyricicoccus, increased significantly after the Med diet and decreased after the FF diet. Bacterially produced metabolites indole-3-lactic acid and indole-3-propionic acid, which have been shown to confer beneficial effects on neuronal cells, increased after the Med diet and decreased after the FF diet. Inter-individual variability in response to the treatments may be related to differences in background diet, for example as shown by differences in Bilophila response in relationship to the saturated fat content of the baseline diet. In conclusion, an animal fat rich, low fiber FF diet vs. a high fiber Med diet altered human gut microbiome composition and its metabolites after just 4 days.","tags":[],"title":"Human gut microbiome composition and tryptophan metabolites were changed differently by fast food and Mediterranean diet in four days: A pilot study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chenghao Zhu","Maurice Wong","Qiongyu Li","Lisa Sawrey-Kubicek","Elizabeth Beals","Chris H.

Ten healthy subjects consumed a fast food (FF) and a Mediterranean (Med) diet for 4 days in randomized order, with a 4-day wash-out between treatments. A multiple reaction monitoring method was used to characterize the site-specific glycoprofiles of HDL proteins, and HDL functional capacity was analyzed. We describe for the first time that ApoE has 7 mucin-type O-glycosylation sites, which were not affected by short-term diet. The glycoprofiles of other HDL-associated proteins were also unaffected, except that a disialylated ApoC-III glycan was enriched after Med diet, and a nonsialylated ApoC-III glycan was enriched after FF diet. Twenty-five individual glycopeptides were significantly correlated with cholesterol efflux capacity and 21 glycopeptides were correlated with immunomodulatory capacity. Results from this study indicate that the glycoprofiles of HDL-associated proteins including ApoE are correlated with HDL functional capacity but generally unaffected by diet in the short term, except ApoC-III sialylation. These results suggest that HDL protein glycoprofiles are affected by both acute and long-term factors and may be useful for biomarker discovery.","tags":[],"title":"Site-Specific Glycoprofiles of HDL-Associated ApoE are Correlated with HDL Functional Capacity and Unaffected by Short-Term Diet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chenghao Zhu","Lisa Sawrey-Kubicek","Elizabeth Beals","Riley L Hughes","Chris H Rhodes","Romina Sacchi","Angela M Zivkovic"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1566000000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566000000,"objectID":"8cc6b2f7d9f0c60e4446ba1d017b8179","permalink":"https://www.chenghaozhu.net/publication/zhu-2019-ffs-lipidome/","publishdate":"2019-08-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhu-2019-ffs-lipidome/","section":"publication","summary":"**INTRODUCTION:** HDL is associated with increased longevity and protection from multiple chronic diseases. The major HDL protein ApoA-I has a half-life of about 4 days, however, the effects of diet on the composition of HDL particles at this time scale have not been studied. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to investigate the short term dietary effect on HDL lipidomic composition.\n**METHODS:** In this randomized order cross-over study, ten healthy subjects consumed a Mediterranean (Med) and a fast food (FF) diet for 4 days, with a 4-day wash-out between treatments. Lipidomic composition was analyzed in isolated HDL fractions by an untargeted LC-MS method with 15 internal standards.\n**RESULTS:** HDL phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) content was increased by FF diet, and 41 out of 170 lipid species were differentially affected by diet. Saturated fatty acids (FAs) and odd chain FA were enriched after FF diet, while very-long chain FA and unsaturated FA were enriched after Med diet. The composition of phosphatidylcholine (PC), triacylglycerol (TG) and cholesteryl ester (CE) were significantly altered to reflect the FA composition of the diet whereas the composition of sphingomyelin (SM) and ceramides were generally unaffected.\n**CONCLUSION:** Results from this study indicate that the HDL lipidome is widely remodeled within 4 days of diet change and that certain lipid classes are more sensitive markers of diet whereas other lipid classes are better indicators of non-dietary factors.","tags":[],"title":"The HDL lipidome is widely remodeled by fast food versus Mediterranean diet in 4 days.","type":"publication"}]
